# Mission // #001
## Comms Check
# Goals
- Get the council members to flip their votes.
- Get the omninode up and running

# Stakes
- Failing to flip this vote may mean many more months of negotiations and debate. If Union doesn't demonstratably improve quality of life here soon, the locals opinion of Union might just get worse somehow.

# Reserves
- None at this time. All our resources are already pointed towards mission success.
